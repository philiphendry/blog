I noticed a [blog entry](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LyalinBlog/~3/245704932/microsoft-certification-for-developers.html) that neatly summarised the exam tracks available at Microsoft but more importantly linked the [Visual Studio 2008](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/sqlvs/offer/default.mspx) exam tracks that should be released imminently - register now and you get a 40% discount!
