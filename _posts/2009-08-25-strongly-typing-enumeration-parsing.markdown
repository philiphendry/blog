Given this enum :

Instead of this code :[![image](/assets/2009/08/image_thumb4.png)](/assets/2009/08/image4.png)

 

I would rather see this :

 

[![image](/assets/2009/08/image_thumb5.png)](/assets/2009/08/image5.png)

 

I canâ€™t add an extension to the Enum system class but I can create a new generic Enum class which strongly types the results :
