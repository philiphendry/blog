I own an HTC Touch HD as was getting a bit annoyed at Internet Explorer being the default browser when selecting links from emails. However, Opera Mobile has a ‘hidden’ configuration screen and can be used to set it as the default :

 

  
  1. Run Opera
   
  2. Enter ‘opera:config’ in the address bar
   
  3. Find the ‘Install’ section
   
  4. Select ‘Browser First Time Launch’ checkbox
   
  5. Press ‘Save’
   
  6. Soft reset
