Here's some code...

// StateMachine.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.  
//  

#include "stdafx.h"  

enum states {  
ST_SYSTEM_OFF,  
ST_LOGIN,  
ST_PRODUCT_ENTRY,  
ST_WRONG_PRODUCT,  
ST_DISPLAY_TOPUP  
};  

Ok - that's something to fix - it hasn't cut & pasted in colour! And now for a screenshot...

Hmmm, this time I used the Vista Snippet Tool but it's not particularly useful. It's a pain having to load a separate tool and then have a new tool window hanging around. I just want to hit a keypress then paste the image into anything I want. I think Microsoft OneNote provides this sort of functionality I think.
