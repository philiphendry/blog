I’ve just started work at a new company that’s got a lot of old hardware stored around the building and was chatting about the first PC I ever started working on back at Hampshire Country Council in 1993 when I tripped over the very thing. An old [IBM P70](http://incolor.inetnebr.com/jshorney/p70.htm#p70) with a mind-blowing array of specs :

 

  
  * 386DX running at 20MHz
   
  * 60MB ESDI hard disk
   
  * 8Mb of RAM
   
  * A built-in 16 gray level gas-plasma screen running at 640x480
