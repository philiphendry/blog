I really feel the need to rant… I’ve just seen the following interface design:

So, you tell me… does this mean Column Guides is already turned on or when you flick the switch you are turning it on? Now I would assume it’s already turned on but the trouble I have here is what is wrong with using old-fashioned interface elements like the ones below? Aren’t they obvious? They may not be pretty but at least you know exactly what it means. Mind you… I have a gripe about the check box control too – sometimes it contains an ‘x’! You know it means the Column Guides are turned on but and ‘x’!!!!
