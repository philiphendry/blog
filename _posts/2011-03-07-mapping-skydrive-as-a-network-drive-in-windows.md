I didn’t realise you could do it until I found an [article](http://www.nirmaltv.com/2010/02/02/how-to-map-skydrive-as-network-drive-in-windows/) describing exactly how to do it and it works a treat! I’m thinking of using my SkyDrive account to backup photos off a NetGear ReadyNAS Duo storage device onto the cloud so they’re all doubly safe!!
