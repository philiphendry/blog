I've been meaning to look at debugging .Net apps on production servers for a while now since each time I've tried with DevEnv.exe I've found I can attach to the process, load up C# source, set breakpoints and step through the code but I can't see the contents of any of the variables.

I'm sure I'll move forward on this problem at a later date but for now I thought I'd jot down a url that discusses a [SOSEX extension](http://www.wintellect.com/cs/blogs/jrobbins/archive/2007/06/18/great-sosex-a-phenomenal-net-debugging-extension-to-see-the-hard-stuff-steve-johnson-is-my-hero.aspx) for use with [WinDBG](http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/DevTools/Debugging/default.mspx). I've not used it at all yet so may well be back with an update to this blog entry later on!
