Have you ever wondered what those strange icons were that appeared next to blog ![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Identicon.svg/180px-Identicon.svg.png)posts such as the example on the right? Well it’s called an [Identicon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon) and it’s an icon that uniquely identifies the source of a post whilst maintaining the privacy of the user – technically it’s a MD5 hash of the users IP address and converted to a 9-block graphic.

 

 

But wait, there’s more. If you’d like a specific icon (a picture of you for example) to follow you around wherever you post then you can sign up for a [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/) – a **g**lobally **r**ecognized **avatar**.
