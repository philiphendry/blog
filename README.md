# Philip Hendry's Blog

My first blog was self-hosted WordPress, then I migrated to [WordPress](http://philiphendry.wordpress.com/) and I've also dabbled with SubText... but it's time or a change. Hosted WordPress is cheap and cheerful but it's restrictions were starting to get a little annoying... but I'm not going back to self-hosting, it's just too much trouble.

Hence the decision to bring things into GitHub which supports Jekyll. More importantly I can use my favourite new editing tool [StackEdit](http://stackedit.io) and publish in markdown directly to GitHub.
